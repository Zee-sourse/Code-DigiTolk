Hi Everyone
My name is Zeeshan Arshad from Pakistan and i have 3 years of experience in Laravel Vue React and MERN.
I dont know how to react to this code like i can put my thoughts into it and make it more efficient but i dont know that if i have to do it on all of the methods or just some of them because there are like 2000 of lines of code. but as i understand it i will share my thoughts on it.


So lets get to the point and talk about code which has been given to me. 


*************************My Thinking of the code***************************************
it's using a Repository Structure/Pattern in which basically BookingRepository is being injected into the BookingController Constructor where we can just call methods from the BookingRepository.
So i have seen the code and let me just say that i don't think it's terrible i think its readable and user can get the idea how its working so it's written fine and it should be working as expected for basic functionality to work with. But of course it can be modified because there is always a room for improvement.
Laravel Documentation states that if you put a lot of code in one file there will be some consequences like Laravel Effecicency wise.
I did'nt really like the part where all of the BookingRepository looks like using a lot of lines which was totally unnecassary there are always helper functions, custom facades, Traits that we can use to reduce the lines it makes the code more organized and more readable.
Im happy to see that its already using Repository Structure but still i have made one JobHelper file but i think it will take time to organize the code and refactor it but it think its just 5 to 7 hours and code can be nore organized.

***************************************************************************************

So lets start from the BookingController which is basically is performing CRUD for user's jobs and updating it with like canceling the job or reopening the job, notifications and stuff like that.  

First i will start from the BookingRepository because its where all of the basic functionality is implemented.

****************************************************************
So i can see that getUsersJobs method is getting jobs of two types of users customer and translator
and return two types of jobs emergency and normal jobs i have put that function in another helper of course a lot of code can be adjusted into different helpers but i have just created one to show you that this is possible for organized code and more readable 
so get usersjobs is like index method which is getting all of the jobs. 
****************************************************************


****************************************************************
There is also this method which is getting users JobHistory like his previous job history...
important is that its also sending pagenumber to frontend so im thinking there is paginations happening on the frontend and you are taking care of it. 
Well for that part it would be easy if laravel Inertia is being used in this project but i think its not so sending pagenumber to frontend fine for this scanario.
****************************************************************


****************************************************************
I see that there this method store and a lot of logic is being rendered i have put some of the code into a helper of course.
same logic is being rendered again and again like failResponse method is showing. it was waste of lines.i dont know who wrote it but it would much easier to put these kind of logics into one method. 
I can also see that lot of if else are being used in this file.like for a small condition there is a if else it would be much easier if we use iterniry operator or some conditions like switch case or something because there is no use of lot of if elsees.
****************************************************************

Most of the methods are ok like storeJobEmail,jobToData,jobEnd,getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId ....
these kind of methods are ok to work with but when there is a lot of lines of code and i think its better to have Custom Facades or BaseControllers where settersm, getters or computed methods to follow up and write clean code.

Of course im not going to explain every method because it will take a lot of time. and i was given i think 2-to-4 hours. 
I have read the code and of course there are lot of modern methods of Eloquent can be used on like search queries and manipulating code.




Im also going to write some tests for methods like getPotentialJobs
